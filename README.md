## Introduction

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The objective is to eat food items that appear randomly on the screen, causing the snake to grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or with the boundaries of the game window.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay
- Snake grows longer as it eats food
- Score tracking
- Game over message displayed when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries

## Dependencies

## Usage

## Controls

- Right Arrow: Move the snake right
